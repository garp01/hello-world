# hello-world
My very first GitHub project and I'm excited to learn 
I passed my AWS Certified Solutions Architect exam in December 2017 and I'm very excited about working in AWS cloud. With that said, I need to learn some tools like GitHub that is very popular with cloud engineers.
I only added contect to this file.
